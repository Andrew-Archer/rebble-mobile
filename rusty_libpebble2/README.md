# libpebble2 Flutter Plugin UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This repo is a plugin for Flutter that makes the libpebble2 python library available to Dart code.

It is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) in order to build a shared library that can be used for [Android](https://www.android.com/) and [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios).
